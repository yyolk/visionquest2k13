By employing and pushing these structures, she attempts to study the ineloquent, oppositional, delusional, frustrating, and chaotic qualities of human interaction.  Lori loves to collaborate and when Implodes (Kranky Records, Chicago) asked Lori to make a video for their awesome song, she said yes.  (LF)"
